            <p>The best eggplant parmesan recipes are extra kind to their 
                namesake vegetable. Start by giving your eggplant an upfront
                 spa treatment: sprinkle the cut pieces with a little salt 
                 and let them sit to sweat out the extra moisture and remove 
                 any bitter notes. This recipe calls for fresh breadcrumbs but 
                 regular dried or Japanese-style panko breadcrumbs – which are
                 coarser – can be used instead. Take your time with frying the 
                 eggplant. Be sure to start with hot oil and wait to check on
                  the pieces until they lift easily with a spatula. 
                  The homemade tomato sauce is incredibly easy. 
                  It only simmers for 10 minutes, so you can check on it 
                  while you pan fry the eggplant.</p>

        <h3>All you have to do is follow these easy steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange the eggplant slices on several baking sheets and 
                    sprinkle generously all over with kosher salt. Set aside
                    to let the bitter juices weep from the eggplant, about 1 hour.</li>
                     <p></p>
                <li>Transfer the eggplant to a colander in the sink, and rinse well under
                    cold running water. Transfer eggplant to a work surface and blot 
                    very dry with paper towels.</li>
                    <p></p>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, breadcrumbs,
                    oregano, thyme, and season with pepper.</li>
                    <p></p>
                <li>Place the flour in a medium lipped plate or bowl. In another 
                    medium bowl, whisk the egg and milk together. Dredge an eggplant
                    slice in the flour, then dip it in the egg, and finally dredge 
                    it in the breadcrumb mixture. Shake off any excess breading and 
                    transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 
                    eggplant.</li>
